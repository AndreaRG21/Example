# Dog Rehoming Project

This project is about creating a system that helps connect dogs in need of a new home with people who want to adopt them. The main idea is to make the process easier by providing information about each dog, their age, breed, personality, and any special needs they may have. The platform is designed to help users quickly find dogs that match their lifestyle and to promote responsible adoption.

## Features

- Contact system for potential adopters to reach out  
- Simple and user-friendly interface
